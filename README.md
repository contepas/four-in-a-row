# 4 in a Row

This MongoExpressNode.js application is a two-player connection game

## Getting Started

Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Gravitrips and Forza 4 (in Italy)) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

### State of the work

The split screen mode of the game is working, and so does the authentication system.
Now that I have everithing in place, I'm working on the implementation of the online multiplayer functionality
